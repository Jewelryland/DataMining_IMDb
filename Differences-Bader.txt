The following are the differences between the tables in the link and our tables respectively:

	Table name 		Our table doesn't have		Their table doesn't have

1) 	name			person_id			gender

2)	role_type		role_id

3) 	char_name		person_role_id

4)	comp_cast_type		status_id, subject_id

5)	company_type		company_type_id

6) 	company_name		company_id

7) 	info_type		info_type_id

8) 	link_type		link_type_id

9)	kind_type		kind_id

10) 	title			movie_id, linked_movie_id,


my observations:
1) person id is in our person_info table
2) I have role_id in cast_info table
3) I have as well person_role_id in cast_info table
4) I have status_id and subject_id in complete _cast table
5) I have company_type_id in the movie_companies table
6) I have company_id in the movie_companies table
7) I have info_type_id in the person_info table
8) I have link_type_id in the movie_link table
9) I have kind_id in the aka_title and title tables
10) I have linked_movie_id in the movie_link and movie_id in cast_info, complete_cast, movie_companies, movie_info, movie_link and aka_title;

I guess it depends on the relationship. Here we have all of them one to many relationships, so an attribute needs to be on the side of n entity (table)
