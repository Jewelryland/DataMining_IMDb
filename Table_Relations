So far i have found a few relations between the tables: The tables are. 
1) role_type - cast_info - comp_cast_type
2) info_type - movie_info - movie_info_idx (check for difference between movie_info & movie_info_idx since I don't have
the entries for that table.)
3)company_type - movie_companies

Most probably the tables of 1 and 2 will also be related to each other. But I don't have them so can't confirm. 
just go through them once more to check if i missed out anything. There will surely be more relations also which we need to find.
